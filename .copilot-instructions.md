# Copilot Instructions

### General Guidelines
- Follow PEP-8 guidelines whenever possible.
- If `uv` can be used to achieve a goal, use it over alternatives
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with minimal but meaningful comments
- Follow the established patterns in the codebase
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use try-catch blocks appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages for users
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

### Performance
- Optimize for readability first, then performance when needed
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Minimize unnecessary re-computations

## Architecture Patterns

### Preferred Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI, business logic, and data access separate
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class should have one clear purpose
- **DRY Principle**: Don't repeat yourself, but don't over-abstract
- **KISS Principle**: Keep it simple and straightforward
